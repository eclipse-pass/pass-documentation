## Release v1.12.0
### Date: October 31, 2024

Release Manager: Tim Sanders, JHU

With this version, weâ€™ve implemented improvements in security, documentation, and fixed some minor bugs. The DOI service now avoids returning entries that lack a URL, and it provides more reliable functionality for retrieving filenames from URLs. Security enhancements include a review of security alerts, the removal of stack trace outputs on the 404 page, and the elimination of default values from sensitive application properties. Additionally, a new AWS feature allows application properties to be optionally loaded from the AWS SSM Parameter Store. Our documentation revamp is complete and accessible on our [new documentation site](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org)!

## Release v1.10.0
### Date: August 28, 2024

Release Manager: Russ Poetker, JHU

This release focused on a new Deposit Services repository integration, NIHMS Data Loader automation, and Release process and Documentation improvements. Deposit services has been enhanced to be able to deposit into InvenioRDM. This can also be tested locally with pass-docker being able to start a local instance of InvenioRDM. There is a new automation available in NIHMS Data Loader for refreshing the NIHMS API Token. We made a change to the pass-core/pass-support releases to align the maven repackage plugin configuration with its latest recommendations. As part of this change, the repackaged jar file is no longer deployed to Maven Central during release. The team continued work on overhauling and improving the existing documentation.

## Release v1.9.0
### Date: July 31, 2024

Release Manager: Russ Poetker, JHU

This release focused on improving deployment tests, addressing technical debt, and improving documentation. Deployment tests were updated to make deposits into downstream repositories optional. If a deployment test deposit is made into a downstream DSpace repository, it will be automatically deleted after the test completes. More deprecations in pass-ui were fixed which allowed pass-ui to be upgraded to Ember v5.8. The pass-ui module now uses Embroider and pnpm for building. The team continued work on overhauling the existing documentation.

## Release v1.8.0
### Date: July 1, 2024

Release Manager: Jared Galanis, JHU

This release focused on improving documentation, addressing technical debt, and fixing bugs. CSRF protection was added to several PASS components. An optional InvenioRDM instance was added to pass-docker. Many deprecations that were preventing an upgrade of pass-ui to Ember v5.x were addressed. The IDP configuration was reworked to be loaded more dynamically via a url instead of a file. The team advanced an overhaul of existing documentation, where many older sources of documentation were reviewed for accuracy, relevance and categorization, and some of which were subsequently synthesized into new forms of documentation.

OpenTofu has been selected as the IaC tool; developing the terraform modules is in progress. A few smaller bugs were also fixed.

## Release v0.2.0
### Date: January 18, 2023

Release Manager: Jim Martino, JHU

Release 0.2.0 provides a major upgrade to the backend architecture of the PASS application.
The Fedora Repository has been replaced with a completely new REST API built using Elide and backed by
Postgres. This change allows the PASS API to be tailored more directly to the purposes of the PASS
application, provides considerable performance enhancements, and reduces maintenance burden.
The structure of the projects making up the PASS application have also been streamlined to simplify
release and deployment procedures. These changes require updates to be made across the application,
such as replacing all uses of the Fedora API within PASS with calls to the new API. For 0.2.0,
this work is completed sufficiently to provide a demonstration of PASS application capabilities,
but certain parts of the application are currently mocked. Full functionality
will be restored in a future release.
