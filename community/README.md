 # Community Documentation

The PASS Community Documentation provides guidelines and resources for contributing to the Eclipse PASS project, 
covering key areas such as [developer guidelines](developer-guidelines.md), the [project roadmap](pass-roadmap.md), and
ways to get involved. It outlines best practices for reporting bugs, contributing code, and testing to ensure a 
high-quality and collaborative development process. The documentation also includes the PASS roadmap, which details 
planned initiatives around user engagement, community building, system administration, and application enhancements.

## Getting Involved

PASS is an open-source community project, and there are many ways to contribute—whether by providing feedback, reporting
bugs, or writing code. Community members are encouraged to:

* Review the existing code base and documentation.
* Test the [PASS demo](https://demo.eclipse-pass.org) instance to understand workflows and features.
* Join discussions on Slack to ask questions or offer suggestions.
* Follow the [pull request workflow](developer-guidelines.md#pull-request-workflow) to submit code contributions.

If you’re new to the project, a great starting point is to try the PASS demo instance to explore the application and 
understand its core functionality.

For more detailed developer information, visit the [PASS Developer Documentation](../developer-documentation) and read 
over the [developer guidelines](developer-guidelines.md). To review the PASS roadmap and stay updated on future 
developments, see our [PASS Roadmap](pass-roadmap.md).
