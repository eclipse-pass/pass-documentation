# Deposit Services - Configuration

The primary mechanism for configuring Deposit Services is through environment variables. This aligns with the patterns
used in development and production infrastructure which rely on Docker and its approach to runtime configuration.

Secondary configuration is provided by Spring Boot `application.properties`. This configuration includes lower-level
parameters such as message queues, the base URL of Pass Core, etc.

## NIHMS Credentials Configuration

In order for PASS to be able to make deposits into NIHMS and monitor for status updates, there are credentials that
need to be created in NIHMS.  Please review the [NIHMS Credentials Configuration](../../infrastructure-documenation/operations-production/ops-nihms.md) 
for the details.

## Repositories Configuration

The Repository configuration contains the parameters used for connecting and depositing custodial material into 
downstream repositories. The format of the configuration file is JSON, defining multiple downstream repositories in a 
single file.

Each repository configuration has a top-level key that is used to identify a particular configuration. Importantly, each
top-level key _must_ map to a `Repository` resource within the PASS repository. This means that the top-level
keys in `repositories.json` are not arbitrary. In fact, the top level key must be:

* the value of a `Repository.repositoryKey` field, which is a `Repository` resource in the PASS repository.

Deposit Services comes with a default repository configuration, but a production environment should override the
default. Defaults are overridden by creating a copy of the default configuration, editing it to suit, and
setting `PASS_DEPOSIT_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION` to point to the new location.

Deposit Services is configured at runtime by a configuration file referenced by the system
property `pass.deposit.repository.configuration` or the environment variable `PASS_DEPOSIT_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION`. By
default, if the system property or environment variable are not present, the classpath
resource `/repositories.json` is used.

> Acceptable values for `PASS_DEPOSIT_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION` must be a form of [Spring Resource URI][1].

A possible repository configuration is replicated below:

```json
{
  "JScholarship": {
    "assembler": {
      "specification": "DSpace",
      "beanName": "DSpaceAssembler"
    },
    "transport-config": {
      "protocol-binding": {
        "protocol": "DSpace"
      }
    }
  },
  "PubMed Central": {
    "assembler": {
      "specification": "nihms-native-2017-07"
    },
    "transport-config": {
      "protocol-binding": {
        "protocol": "sftp",
        "username": "${pmc.ftp.user}",
        "password": "${pmc.ftp.password}",
        "server-fqdn": "${pmc.ftp.host}",
        "server-port": "${pmc.ftp.port}",
        "default-directory": "/upload/%s"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Customizing Repository Configuration Elements

Values may be parameterized by any property or environment variable.

To create your own configuration, copy and paste the default configuration into an empty file and modify the JSON as
described above. The configuration _must_ be referenced by the `pass.deposit.repository.configuration` property, or is
environment equivalent `PASS_DEPOSIT_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION`. Allowed values are any [Spring Resource path][1] (
e.g. `classpath:/`, `classpath*:`, `file:`, `http://`, `https://`). For example, if your configuration is stored as a
file in `/etc/deposit-services.json`, then you would set the environment
variable `PASS_DEPOSIT_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION=file:/etc/deposit-services.json` prior to starting Deposit Services.
Likewise, if you kept the configuration accessible at a URL, you could
use `PASS_DEPOSIT_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION=http://example.org/deposit-services.json`.


## Configuring the NIHMS Email Service

The NIHMS email service is responsible for parsing emails from NIHMS that contain different error codes on deposits. 
Currently, NIHMS only communicates its deposit status via email. Setting up an email account that will receive emails
from NIHMS is a prerequisite. The email account that is set up should be represented by the value of 
`NIHMS_MAIL_USERNAME`. 

There are two authentication protocols supported by this service. A regular SMTP login credentials and Microsoft 
Exchange OAuth2. By providing a value of `LOGIN` or `MS_EXCHANGE_OAUTH2` for the environmental value, it will determine
which type of authentication to use. If using the `MS_EXCHANGE_OAUTH2` authentication type, then `NIHMS_MAIL_TENANT_ID`,
`NIHMS_MAIL_CLIENT_ID`, and `NIHMS_MAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` are required as well.

## Configuring the Deployment Test Data Service

The Deployment Test Data Service is responsible for cleaning up Submission/Deposit data created by Deployment Tests that
run against live PASS environments. To enable the job that executes the Deployment Test Data Service,
`pass.test.data.job.enabled` needs to be set to `true`. The `TEST_DATA*` environment variables need to be configured 
as well.

By default, Submissions created by Deployment Tests that are received by Deposit Services are fully processed; however,
the Deposit is not actually sent to the remote repository. This can be changed by setting `TEST_DATA_SKIP_DEPOSITS` to 
`false`, which will then send the Deposit to the remote repository. Additionally, when `TEST_DATA_SKIP_DEPOSITS`
is `false`, if the remote repository is a DSpace repository, the Deposit Item in DSpace will be deleted by the 
Deployment Test Data Service.
