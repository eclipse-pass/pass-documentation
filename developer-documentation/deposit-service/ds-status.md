# Deposit Services - Statuses

Deposit Services primarily acts on three types of resources: `Submission`, `Deposit`, and `RepositoryCopy`. Each of
these resources carries a status. Managing and reacting to the values of resource statuses is a major function of 
Deposit Services.

Abstractly, Deposit Services categorizes the value of any status as either _intermediate_, or _terminal_.

A _terminal_ status means the resource has completed its workflow and reached the end. No additional state changes are 
expected, and the resource is considered final and read-only.

An _intermediate_ status means the resource is still in progress within its workflow and has not yet reached completion. 
The resource is expected to be modified until it achieves a _terminal_ status.

A general pattern within Deposit services is that resources with _terminal_ status are explicitly accounted for (this is
largely enforced by _policies_ which are documented elsewhere), and are considered "read-only".

## Submission Status

Submission status is enumerated in the `AggregatedDepositStatus` class. Deposit services considers the following values:

* `NOT_STARTED` (_intermediate_): Incoming Submissions from the UI must have this status value.
* `IN_PROGRESS` (_intermediate_): Deposit services places the Submission in an `IN_PROGRESS` state right away. When a
  thread observes a `Submission` in this state, it assumes that _another_ thread is processing this resource.
* `FAILED` (_intermediate_): Occurs when a non-recoverable error happens while processing the `Submission`.
* `ACCEPTED` (_terminal_): Deposit services places the Submission into this state when all of its `Deposit`s have
  been `ACCEPTED`.
* `REJECTED` (_terminal_): Deposit services places the Submission into this state when all of its `Deposit`s have
  been `REJECTED`.

## Deposit Status

Deposit status is enumerated in the `DepositStatus` class. Deposit services considers the following values:

* `SUBMITTED` (_intermediate_): the custodial content of the `Submission` has been successfully transferred to
  the `Deposit`s `Repository`.
* `ACCEPTED` (_terminal_): the custodial content of the `Submission` has been accessioned by the `Deposit`.
  s `Repository` (i.e. custody of the `Submission` has successfully been transferred to the downstream `Repository`.
* `REJECTED` (_terminal_): the custodial content of the `Submission` has been rejected by the `Deposit`'s `Repository` (
  i.e. the downstream `Repository` has refused to accept custody of the `Submission` content).
* `FAILED` (_intermediate_): the transfer of custodial content to the `Repository` failed, or there was some other error
  updating the status of the `Deposit`.

## RepositoryCopy Status

RepositoryCopy status is enumerated in the `CopyStatus` class. Deposit services considers the following values:

* `COMPLETE` (_terminal_): a copy of the custodial content is available in the `Repository` at this location.
* `IN_PROGRESS` (_intermediate_): a copy of the custodial content is _expected to be_ available in the `Repository` at
  this location. The custodial content should not be expected to exist until the `Deposit` status is `ACCEPTED`.
* `REJECTED` (_terminal_): the copy should be considered to be invalid. Even if the custodial content is made available
  at the location indicated by the `RepositoryCopy`, it should not be mistaken for a successful transfer of custody.

RepositoryCopy status is subservient to the `Deposit` status. They will always be consistent. For example, 
a `RepositoryCopy` cannot be `COMPLETE` if the Deposit is `REJECTED`. If a `Deposit` is `REJECTED`, then the 
`RepositoryCopy` must also be `REJECTED`.

## Common Permutations

There are some common permutations of these statuses that will be observed:

* `ACCEPTED` `Submission`s will only have `Deposit`s that are `ACCEPTED`. Each `Deposit` will have
  a `COMPLETE` `RepositoryCopy`.
* `REJECTED` `Submission`s will only have `Deposit`s that are `REJECTED`.  `REJECTED` `Deposit`s will not have
  any `RepositoryCopy` at all.
* `IN_PROGRESS` `Submission`s may have zero or more `Deposit`s in any state.
* `FAILED` `Submission`s should have zero `Deposit`s.
* `ACCEPTED` `Deposit`s should have a `COMPLETE` `RepositoryCopy`.
* `REJECTED` `Deposit`s will have a `REJECTED` `RepositoryCopy`.
* `SUBMITTED` `Deposit`s will have an `IN_PROGRESS` `RepositoryCopy`.
* `FAILED` `Deposit`s will have no `RepositoryCopy`.
