# Repository Copy

A Repository Copy represents a copy of a [Publication](publication.md) that exists in a target [Repository](repository.md). The Repository Copy either (1) was the result of an accepted [Deposit](deposit.md) from PASS, in which case there would be a link to the Copy from the related Deposit record, or (2) was created outside of PASS by some other process. In this second instance, the PASS system stores the information to help determine whether a Publication is already compliance.

| externalIds | String[] | IDs assigned to this entity by the target repository |
| copyStatus* | String | Status of the copy in the external repository's workflow ([_see list below_](#copy-status-options)) |
| accessUrl | String | URL to access the item in the repository, could allow Users to see the final result |

## Copy status options

These are the possible statuses for a Deposit in the order they could occur. Note that not all repositories will go through every status.

| Value  		  | Description |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| accepted | The target [Repository](repository.md) has indicated that the Deposit has been accepted|
| in-progress | The target [Repository](repository.md) is processing the files |
| stalled | The target [Repository](repository.md) has detected a problem that has caused the progress to stall. This will likely require some direct interaction with the repository to re-initiate the process. Examples include, when there are incorrect files, or when a user did not respond to a validation request in a resonable time. |
| complete | The target [Repository](repository.md) has accepted the files, and publication is pending if not already complete |
| rejected | The target [Repository](repository.md) has rejected the files. |
