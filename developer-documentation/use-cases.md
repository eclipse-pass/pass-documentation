# Use Cases

# Direct submission

* Principal Investigator (PI) users can review their grants and create submissions to designated repositories based on applicable policies.
* A PI can see past submissions made to PubMed Central (PMC).
* A submitter can create a submission that satisfies one or more grants' open access policies (PASS will determine which open access policies apply to a grant).
* A submitter can create one submission that the system will deposit into an institutional repository and/or PubMed Central (potential support for more repositories in the future).

# Proxy submission

* As an authenticated user of PASS, I want to be able to prepare a submission on behalf of someone else.
* As an authenticated user of PASS, I want to be able to approve and submit submissions that were created on my behalf.
