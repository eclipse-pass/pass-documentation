# PASS Release

This release section outlines the overall process and steps to perform the community release of PASS. It provides in-depth details of each step and the procedures to perform the release manually. There are workflows available that [automate the release process](release-steps-with-automations.md), which can release all projects at once or release them individually.

## Summary

A PASS release produces a set of Java artifacts, and Docker images. Java artifacts are pushed to Sonatype Nexus and Maven Central repositories. Docker images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry. The PASS Docker environment is updated with references to the released images. Source code is tagged and release notes made available.

Each release of PASS has its own version which is used by every component. PASS uses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) approach.
The version should be chosen based on those guidelines.

## Community Preparation

* Assign a Release Manager, the person who will be responsible for the release process. The Release Manager must be a [PASS committer](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-cm).
* Ensure all code commits and PRs intended for the release have been merged.
* Issue a code freeze statement on the [Eclipse PASS slack #pass-dev channel](https://eclipse-pass.slack.com/archives/C035MNLRD44) to notify all developers that a release is imminent and that no further changes will be considered.

## Process

* Choose a release version that communicates the magnitude of the change.
* Create a release checklist issue from the [main repository create new issue page](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/issues/new/choose).
* Perform the release.
* Test the release.
* Publish release notes.
* Post a message about the release to the [PASS Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/pass-general).
  * Release manager will draft the message, allowing the [technical lead](https://github.com/markpatton) and [community manager](https://github.com/kineticsquid) to provide feedback before posting.
  * Message should include at least: an overview of the high level changes in the release, plans for the next release, and a link to the changelog for the release.

A new release for each relevant project should be created in the GitHub user interface until automation is put in place.

The release notes are generated automatically by GitHub, but references to the release artifacts should be added manually.

## Release Requirements

Most of the PASS release process is automated new, but if we need to do parts of the process manually, make sure the following software is installed:

| Name           | Version |
|----------------|---------|
| Java           | 17      |
| Maven          | 3.8.x   |
| Docker         | 20.10.x |
| Docker Compose | 2.x     | 

### Sonatype

The Sonatype deployment is handled by the automations. This information is provided for doing a Java release manually.

Developers will need a Sonatype account to release Java projects.
Maven must be configured to use the account by modifying your `~/.m2/settings.xml`. To learn more about Sonatype, documentation is available on their [website](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/).

Example pom setup:
```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>YOUR_SONATYPE_USERNAME</username
      <password>YOUR_SONATYPE_PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <gpg.executable>gpg</gpg.executable>
        <gpg.passphrase>YOUR_GPG_PASSPHRASE</gpg.passphrase>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>

```
### GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

Developers will need a GitHub account which is a member of the [eclipse-pass](https://github.com/eclipse-pass) organization. 

## Release Sequence

**The [Publish: Release All](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/actions/workflows/pass-complete-release.yml) GitHub workflow will release all projects in the correct order.**  

If a manual release is required, an order must be followed. The Java projects must follow a strict sequence, following its dependency hierarchy. Other Javascript based projects can be released in any order. Both the Java and non-Java releases can be done in parallel, as there are no direct code dependencies between them.

1. [`main`](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main)
2. Java projects
   1. [`pass-core`](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/pass-core)
   2. [`pass-support`](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/pass-support)
3. Non-Java projects
   * [`pass-ui`](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/pass-ui)
   * [`pass-acceptance-testing`](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/pass-acceptance-testing)
4. [`pass-docker`](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/pass-docker)

These projects have GitHub workflow automations in place to perform releases that need to be triggered manually. See more detailed [release steps with automations](release-steps-with-automations.md).

## Java Release

The release automations will follow these steps. **You will only need to follow this process if the automations fail.**

Maven is used to perform many of the release tasks:

* Sets versions and builds 
* Tests
* Pushes release artifacts 
* May also build Docker images

The versions of all the Java artifacts are the same for a release. The parent pom in `main` sets the version to be inherited by all its children. This project therefore needs to be released first, as all other projects need to reference it. After this is released, other projects are released in an order which guarantees that all PASS dependencies for them have already been released. You will need to wait for artifacts to show up in Maven Central before building a module which depends on them.

The process itself can be described as follows: release `main`, . For convenience, we set and export environment variables RELEASE for the release version, and NEXT for the next development version (an example might be executing `export RELEASE=0.1.0` and `export NEXT=0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`)
For each of these child projects, we first clone the source from GitHub, and operating on the principal branch (usually `main`).

Update the reference to the parent pom and set the release version.
```
mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$RELEASE
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$RELEASE
```

After this, we do build and push the artifacts to Sonatype, commit the version change, and tag it:
```
mvn -ntp -P release clean deploy
git commit -am "Update version to $RELEASE"
git tag $RELEASE
```

Push any created images to GHCR after logging in. Visit the GitHub docs [Working with the Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) for more information.
```
docker push IMAGE_NAME:$RELEASE
```

Push commits and tags to GitHub:
```
git push origin
git push origin --tags
```

Finally, the new development code needs to be pushed to built and pushed GitHub. Repeat the process above with the dev version, but do not create the tag.

At this point, we should have deployed the release to Sonatype (and eventually to Maven Central), pushed a tag to GitHub, and deployed the new development release to Sonatype.

In addition, the project may be released on GitHub. This provides a way to add release notes for a particular project. A GitHub release is done manually by uploading artifacts through the UI. The release version and tag should be the same used for Maven Central. Release notes can be automatically generated from commit messages and then customized.

See the GitHub [Java Release Workflow](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) for the details on the exact commands that are run.

### Manual Release Steps for Main, Pass-Core, Pass-Support

* Update POM to release version
* Commit release version update
* Tag release version
* Build and deploy to Sonatype
* Push any generated Docker images to GHCR
* Update POM to dev version
* Commit dev version update
* Build and deploy to Sonatype
* Wait for artifacts in Maven Central
* Push any generated Docker images to GHCR
* Push commits to GitHub


## JavaScript Projects

The following projects can be released by performing the following steps when the release needs to be performed manually.

### PASS-UI

Update the version in `package.json` and in `build.sh`, and commit those changes via a PR to the `pass-ui` repo.

Build a new docker image from within the `pass-ui` repo by running:
```
sh build.sh ~/pass-docker/.env
```
Note, you might want to ensure `node_modules` are removed first to ensure a clean build.

Push that image to GHCR. For example: `docker push ghcr.io/eclipse-pass/pass-ui:<your-version-tag-here>`

### PASS-Auth

Update the version in `package.json`, and commit that change via a PR to the `pass-auth` repo.

Build a new docker image from within the `pass-auth`, for example by running:
```
docker build --no-cache -t ghcr.io/eclipse-pass/pass-auth:<your-version-tag>
```
Push that image to GHCR. For example: `docker push ghcr.io/eclipse-pass/pass-auth:<your-version-tag-here>`

### PASS-Acceptance Testing

All that's required is to tag a new release in the GitHub UI.

After pushing the images to GHCR, update the appropriate image lines in `docker-compose.yml` in `pass-docker` with the new sha returned by the pushes to GHCR. Open a pull request against `pass-docker` with these updates.

Once acceptance-tests successfully run in CI in your `pass-docker` PR, and preferrably once you've done some additional manual spot checking while running `pass-docker` locally, go ahead and tag a new release in the Github UI for each of `pass-ui`, `pass-ui-public`, `pass-auth` and `pass-acceptance-testing`. 

## Image Customization

Here's what you need to change manually before building a new image version in order to bring in code changes. If the docker compose service is not mentioned here, you do not need to make any manual changes. All images must be built manually using docker compose, following the [docker compose rebuilding / updating](#docker compose-rebuilding--updating) steps except `pass-core` which is built by Maven.

### Building `pass-ui` Image
In `.env`, by default, `EMBER_GIT_BRANCH` should have a value of `main`. If you need to point to a specific branch update the value of `EMBER_GIT_BRANCH`. You can use the name of a tag or a specific commit hash.

## Testing

Manual testing can be done using the newly updated pass-docker to run the release locally. Acceptance testing is run automatically on GitHub against pass-docker/main.

## Post Release

  * Update release notes
  * Update project documentation
  * Deploying the release

### Update Release Notes

1. Ensure that there is a milestone for the release.
2. Get a list of all issues that are closed and in the eclipse-pass project by going to the [main repository issue list](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+project%3Aeclipse-pass%2F4).
3. Check that the correct tickets are in the release milestone.
4. Archive the release tickets in the Project by going to the [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-pass/projects/4/views/2), scrolling to the Done column, verifying that all tickets in the list have the new version tag, then selecting the ellipsis button and "Archive all cards".
5. Include in the Release Notes a link to the issues resolved by the release, for example [this milestone](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/milestone/11?closed=1).
