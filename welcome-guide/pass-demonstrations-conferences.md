In 2023, the PASS team at Johns Hopkins University achieved significant milestones including a series of monthly releases that introduced a new back-end architecture, enhanced API, and a range of system improvements to support a more efficient and user-friendly experience. Alongside development, the team engaged in community building with academic partners and hosting providers to explore piloting opportunities and integration needs for 2024.

### Eclipse PASS Project Briefing, January 2023

In 2022, the Public Access Submission System (PASS) project embarked on significant advancements, notably transitioning to an Eclipse Foundation open-source project, and upgrading its server architecture. This strategic move to the Eclipse Foundation enhanced PASS with engineering, community management, and organizational governance expertise, enabling more effective collaboration with agencies and institutions. Furthermore, the architectural upgrade enhanced the system's API, simplified deployment, and streamlined system management, setting the stage for broader community engagement and institutional collaboration.
