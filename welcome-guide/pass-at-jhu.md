# Pass at JHU

Since its inception in 2019, PASS at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) has been a vehicle for research submission and compliance. In 2023, we proudly introduced our 1.0 release, featuring a major overhaul of our back-end architecture. This update introduced a robust and well-defined API, streamlined our release process, aligned dependencies, and restructured components for easier system management. Designed to fit the needs of the Office of Science and Technology [memo ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf)and aligns with JHU’s own Open Access Policy, PASS ensures that all JHU researchers can effortlessly publish their work to JHU's institutional repository, [JScholarship](https://provost.jhu.edu/faqs/what-is-jscholarship/).

Beyond meeting JHU’s requirements, PASS at JHU facilitates submissions to PubMed Central through the [NIH Manuscript Submission](https://www.nihms.nih.gov/) (NIHMS) system. Looking ahead, we’re excited to expand our support to additional repositories, such as NSF. Take a look at our [PASS Roadmap](pass-roadmap.md) article for a glimpse into the future features and enhancements in the pipeline.

Architecturally, PASS is built on Amazon Web Services and leverages a Java Spring Boot web application paired with a REST API for seamless core service integration. While we’ve chosen AWS for its reliability and scalability, it’s essential to note that PASS’s flexibility allows it to thrive on various platforms. For an in-depth look at our system’s blueprint, we invite you to explore our [Deployment Architecture](deployment-architecture.md) article.
