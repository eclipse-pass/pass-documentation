# Research Submission Overview

The journey of research from conception to dissemination is a long one. After designing your study, gathering and
analyzing your data, undergoing peer review, there is still more to be done. For many researchers the next stage is
submitting your manuscripts and all the supporting documents to a variety of repositories, as dictated by the
requirements of funding bodies and academic institutions.

## Challenges Faced by Researchers

Identifying the appropriate repositories for submission is not always straightforward. Researchers often juggle multiple
grants, each with its unique set of requirements. Gathering all this information can be time consuming and using many
systems can be tedious and frustrating. The workflows for each system can be complex and navigating these systems can be
burdensome. Additionally, there can be processing charges for each repository, which are often incurred on a
per-repository basis, cannot be overlooked.

## PASS: Solving submission challenges

The Eclipse Public Access Submission System (PASS) is a web-based system that aims to solves these challenges. PASS is
engineered to support researchers, IT personnel, compliance officers, and executives in meeting the access policies of
their funders and institutions both efficiently and economically.

By leveraging Eclipse PASS to submit your manuscripts to both funder and institutional publication repositories
(such as PubMed Central, DSpace) your workflow becomes streamlined, ensuring compliance and avoiding costly article
processing charges to make your publication open to the public. By simply signing into PASS, it gathers all the relevant
information about your grants, publications, and previous submissions to populate forms with publication and author
information by providing DOIs and ORCID IDs. It simultaneously sends your manuscript to multiple repositories seamlessly
with a few single clicks!

Our mission is to support researchers, and we know the frustrations and challenges researchers face trying to get their
research easily accessible in the public domain. PASS was originally built in collaboration by the Eclipse Foundation
and the Digital Research Curation Center at Johns Hopkins Sheridan Libraries. As an evolving open-source project, PASS
welcomes the collaboration of universities and institutions, aiming to continually refine and enhance a platform that
frees up researchers to do what they're passionate about: pushing the boundaries of what we know.
