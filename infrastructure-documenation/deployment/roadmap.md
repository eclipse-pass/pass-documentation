## Introduction

This document outlines the roadmap for transitioning the Eclipse Public Access Submission System (PASS) from its current Docker Compose-based deployment to a cloud-native Kubernetes deployment. This transition aims to improve scalability, resilience, and manageability of the PASS platform.

## Current State

- Deployment primarily uses Docker Compose
- Infrastructure hosted on AWS (EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, ALB, WAF)
- Manual scaling and management of components

## Target Architecture

The target architecture will leverage Kubernetes for orchestration and cloud-native principles:

- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Amazon EKS, self-managed K8s on EC2)
- Containerized microservices
- Helm charts for deployment management

### Future Possibilities

- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- Istio for service mesh
- CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes deployment

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Planning
- Analyze current architecture and identify components for containerization
- Define Kubernetes resource requirements
- Plan data migration strategy
- Identify necessary changes to application code for Kubernetes compatibility

### Phase 2: Containerization and Kubernetes Basics
- Containerize all PASS components
- Create initial Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps)
- Set up a test Kubernetes cluster
- Implement basic health checks and readiness probes

### Phase 3: Kubernetes Integration and Testing
- Develop Helm charts for PASS components
- Integrate persistent storage solutions (e.g., persistent volumes for databases)
- Implement secrets management
- Set up ingress controllers and configure routing
- Conduct thorough testing of the Kubernetes deployment

### Phase 4: Advanced Kubernetes Features and Optimization
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
- Set up cluster autoscaling
- Optimize resource requests and limits
- Implement pod disruption budgets for high availability
- Configure liveness probes for self-healing

### Phase 5: Monitoring, Logging, and Security
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack)
- Configure network policies for enhanced security
- Implement pod security policies

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Adapt CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes deployment
- Implement GitOps practices with tools like ArgoCD or Flux
- Set up canary deployments and rollback mechanisms

### Phase 7: Production Migration and Optimization
- Perform staged migration to production Kubernetes environment
- Optimize performance and resource utilization
- Conduct load testing and fine-tuning
- Document new deployment and management processes

## Key Milestones

1. All PASS components successfully containerized
2. Basic Kubernetes deployment functional in test environment
3. Helm charts created and tested for all components
4. Monitoring and logging solutions implemented
5. CI/CD pipeline fully integrated with Kubernetes deployment
6. Production environment migrated to Kubernetes
7. Performance optimization and fine-tuning completed

## Challenges and Considerations

- Ensuring data integrity during migration
- Managing stateful applications in Kubernetes (e.g., databases)
- Balancing resource allocation and cost optimization
- Training team members on Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies
- Ensuring security and compliance in the new architecture

## Timeline

Some phases may run concurrently, others sequentially.

- Phase 1: 1-2 sprints
- Phase 2: 2-3 sprints
- Phase 3: 3-4 sprints
- Phase 4: 2-3 sprints
- Phase 5: 2-3 sprints
- Phase 6: 1-2 sprints
- Phase 7: 2-3 sprints
