# Operations/Production - PASS Design & AWS Architecture

The PASS design supports flexible and scalable submission workflows of research publications. It consists of four main
components: PASS UI, Data Loaders, PASS Core, and Deposit Services. PASS Core acts as the central backbone, coordinating
the workflow through, Elide, a JSON:API that interfaces with various services. It stores documents using the 
Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) on disk or through an S3 bucket, while the backend services are written in Java using 
Spring Boot. Data Loaders handle the ingestion of journal, grant, and publication data, while Deposit Services manage 
the deposits of submissions into various repositories like DSpace and NIH. The architecture is deployed primarily on AWS,
leveraging services such as Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Container Service (ECS), Simple Storage Service (S3), 
and Simple Queue Service (SQS) to ensure high availability, scalability, and security. This setup allows PASS to 
efficiently handle submission workflows and deposit services across diverse environments, adhering to institutional 
policies and data governance standards. It is important to note that the AWS architecture is a choice by JHU, but PASS 
can run on other cloud providers or run on infrastructure that is local to the institution. The different components of
PASS and their associated production setup and operations will be discussed in this article.

A quick review of the PASS design and application architecture from our [Deployment and Architecture page](../../welcome-guide%2Fdeployment-architecture.md)
in the [PASS Welcome Guide](../../welcome-guide). Both the PASS Design diagram and Application 
Architecture diagram are below for a quick reference:

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
The infrastructure operates across two VPCs. The main VPC, hosts the PASS components and is 
equipped with both public and private subnets, without direct connectivity to the JHU network. The secondary VPC, 
includes a private subnet with connectivity to the JHU network, facilitating secure data access and integration with
resources within the JHU networks, such as the Grant loader and JHU's institutional repository.

## Application Load Balancers (ALB)
There are two ALBs, one for handling external traffic and another for internal communication between the different 
components of PASS. The public load balancers handles requests for the domain name. All traffic is forwarded to HTTPS,
and there is a security group that is attached, allowing only inbound/outbound requests to specific ports. The other
load balancer for internal communication has as similar setup but forwards to an internal host name. Similarly, it has
an attached security group for permitting specific ports for inbound/outbound requests.

* **Public PASS ALB**
  * Public load balancer to handle requests for internet requests.  
  * Certificate above is set on the HTTPS listener.
  * HTTPS listener forwards requests to public Target Group.
* **Private Pass Core ALB**
  * Private load balancer to handle requests for VPC private network requests. Used by backend services/data loaders to 
  communicate with Pass Core API. Private Hosted Zone used in Route 53.
  * HTTP listener forwards requests to private Target Group.
* **Target Groups**
  * Target Groups are used by ALBs to forward requests to the EC2 instances running the Pass-core/Pass-UI docker 
containers. 
  * There are two target groups, one for the public ALB and one for the private ALB.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A WAF sits at the edge of the architecture boundary, as pictured in the PASS Application Architecture diagram, between
the end users and the PASS ALB. It is responsible for applying a set of rules to filter out traffic and protect the
internal virtual network.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Security Groups
AWS IAM and security groups are used manage the access and security of the PASS application. Following best security 
practices IAM Roles have been created with least privilege policies and assigned to the resources. Additionally, 
Security Groups have been created and assigned to AWS resources to restrict inbound and outbound connections to align 
with least privilege access.

## Certificate Manager
The certificate for the PASS public domain name for JHU is in AWS Certificate Manager.

## Simple Email Service (SES)
SES is enabled in production mode for sending emails from the notifications service.

## PASS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker 
container images. It's leveraged in the PASS Application Architecture by giving a centralized repository images for PASS
Core, PASS UI, Data Loaders, Deposit Services, and Notification Services.

## Data Loaders
The Data Loaders (Journal, Grant, Publication) are executed as AWS Batch jobs within ECS Fargate compute 
environments, each designed to accommodate specific data processing needs. The batch jobs leverage AWS services like S3
for configuration management, SQS for messaging, EventBridge Scheduler for scheduling batch jobs, and ECS Fargate for 
executing the containerized data loaders. The architecture also integrates AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access 
controls, ensuring that data loaders have the required permissions for accessing resources like S3 buckets and 
connecting to the PASS Core API.

## Submission UI (PASS UI)
PASS UI integrates with Shibboleth for authentication, providing a single sign-on experience for users. Shibboleth is a 
single sign-on system that is used at JHU. The interoperability of this depends on the institution and the header
variables in the web browser that are passed by the identity provider. Please contact the PASS team for more information
regarding how to integrate with SSO. PASS-UI interacts with AWS infrastructure by utilizing EC2 instances for hosting, 
ALBs for managing traffic, and S3 for storing static assets.

## PASS Core
PASS Core is deployed on EC2 instances. These instances are part of the main VPC and are configured to run the PASS Core
API and associated services. Configuration files and deployment scripts for PASS Core and other components are stored in
S3, allowing for easy access and management during deployments and updates. In addition, the AWS Systems Manager 
parameter store contains configuration of environment variables in the PASS application. PASS Core uses SQS for message
queuing to handle asynchronous communication between different components of the PASS system. For example, when a 
submission is made, a message is placed in an SQS queue, which is then processed by the deposit services.

## File and Bytes Persistence
PASS Core uses Amazon S3 to store submission-related documents and metadata. The OCFL is employed to organize these 
files, providing options for local disk storage or S3 bucket retention. The configuration of the File Service in PASS 
Core is done through environment variables that are set in the Systems Manager parameter store.

## Relational Database
PASS Core uses Amazon RDS, specifically a PostgreSQL database, to store and manage data related to publications, 
submissions, grants, and policies. The RDS instance resides within the same VPC and is not publicly accessible, 
consequently this means devops cannot connect directly to the database using SQL tools; however by using jumpbox it is 
possible to connect via an SSM managed session if needed. The EC2 instances running PASS Core communicate with the RDS 
instance over the VPCâ€™s internal network. Security groups are configured to allow traffic between PASS Core and the RDS 
database, ensuring secure data access.

## Deposit Services
Deposit Services are responsible for processing submission data from PASS Core and ensuring it is correctly formatted 
and packaged for deposit into external repositories. This involves transforming submission metadata and bundling content
according to repository requirements. It is deployed as containerized applications using ECS Fargate. As described in
the Application Architecture, Deposit services leverages SQS to handle the asynchronous processing of deposit tasks. 
When a submission is ready for deposit, PASS Core places a message in an SQS queue, which Deposit Services then pick up
for processing. The Deposit Service ECS task is configured to be able to access ECR, SSM Parameter store, SQS, and S3. 
Deposit services read messages from SQS queues. Deposit services reads the repository.json configuration file from an 
S3 bucket.

## Publication Queue
SQS publication queue serves as a decoupling mechanism between the PASS Core and Deposit Services. Submissions are 
processed asynchronously, resulting in a system that remains responsive and efficient. There are three queues that are
used by the overall PASS environment: `deposit`, `submission`, and `submission-event`.

## Notification Services
This ECS Service runs tasks where the Notification Services message listeners consume messages from the submission 
event queues. It is safe to scale these tasks out if needed. The Notification Service ECS task is configured to be 
able to access the ECR, SSM Parameter store, and SQS. SES enabled in production mode for sending emails from 
the notifications service.
