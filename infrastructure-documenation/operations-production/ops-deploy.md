# Operations/Production - How to Deploy
In this article the JHU instance of PASS will be used to demonstrate how we deploy the application to production. As 
with the JHU architecture decisions, deployment will be done in various ways and will likely vary between institutions 
depending on their architecture. It is important to note that there is a process of testing and stepping through 
development and staging environments before deploying to production. This articles will focus on one deployment workflow
to a production environment.
