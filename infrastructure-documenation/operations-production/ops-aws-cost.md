# Operations/Production - AWS Cost Estimates
In making the decision to use AWS for PASS production infrastructure, cost will invariably be a deciding factor. This
article describes the various cost factors and cost estimates sampling of running such an architecture as described in
[PASS Design & AWS Architecture](./ops-aws-arch.md). Costs will of course be variable and dependent on the exact 
implementation.

## AWS Resource Cost Factors
The table below contains the AWS resources used by JHU and the configuration options that will impact the cost for each 
resource most significantly. The order of the resources is based on percentage of the monthly expense, for instance AWS 
RDS is the most expensive resource in our implementation. The JHU Configuration column has details for each resource as
of September 2024 for what our system currently requires for compute, storage, IO, and monitoring. The [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) 
can be used to estimate cost for a PASS application AWS architecture to your specifications.

### AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)

### AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

* **Cost Factors**
    * Storage Type
    * Storage Size
* **JHU Configuration**
    * ~ 5 Buckets
    * ~ 3 GB Total as of Sept 2024
* [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)


## AWS Cost Metrics Sampling
JHUâ€™s PASS production architecture detailed above results in a fairly-consistent operating cost totaling $700-$800 per
month.

* About half of the spend is dedicated to the High Availability (HA) production database.
* Compute resources comprise roughly a quarter of the spend.
* The remainder of the cost is spread across supporting services, such as monitoring logging, and security.
* Storage costs for PASS are currently negligible.
