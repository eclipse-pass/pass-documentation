# Introduction

This module is a Spring Boot application which provides the PASS REST API.

# Building

Java 17 and Maven 3.8 required.

```
mvn clean install
```

This will produce an executabler jar `pass-core-main/target/pass-core-main.jar` and a docker image `ghcr.io/eclipse-pass/pass-core-main`.

# Running local build

```
java -jar pass-core-main.jar
```

By default an in memory database is used.

Look at http://localhost:8080/swagger/ to see the auto-created documentation and a UI for testing out the api.

You can directly make request with the UI and see what happens. Note when doing a POST to create an object, be sure to edit the type field to have the correct object type and delete the id field to have the id auto-generated.

## Running with Docker

This uses Postgres.

In pass-core-main run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

# Configuration

The application is configured by its application.yaml which in turn references a number of environment variables.

By default, pass-core-main, will run with an in memory database. In order to use Postgres, switch to the production profile and set the database environment variables as below.
The liquibase changelog located `pass-core-main/src/main/resources/db/changelog/changelog.yaml` will create the pass-core database schema if needed.

If `PASS_CORE_USE_SQS` is `true`, then pass-core will attempt to connect to Amazon SQS. The connection must be configured with `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
The AWS credentials are also needed if the file service S3 backend is used.

Otherwise a connection to an ActiveMQ broker can be configured by setting `SPRING_ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL`. If 'PASS_CORE_EMBED_JMS_BROKER` is true, then an embedded ActiveMQ broker will be started
using that url. This can be useful to set tcp transport for connecting containers in a docker environment. The default is an embedded broker using vm transport.

Environment variables:
* spring_profiles_active=production
* AWS_REGION=us-east-1
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
* PASS_CORE_APP_LOCATION=classpath:app

  * If not present, one is generated. See the [user service](pass-core-user-service/README.md) for how to create manually.
* PASS_CORE_JAVA_OPTS=""
  * Used by the Docker image to pass arguments to Java
* PASS_CORE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
  * Used when services send URLs to the client such as relationship links.

The environment variables in `pass-core-main/.env` are intended to be used for local testing of pass-core in isolation.

# Access control

SAML 2.0 and HTTP basic authentication are supported. An authenticated user is either authorized with a `BACKEND` or `SUBMITTER` role.

A user that does a SAML login is mapped to a PASS user using locator ids. The provided SAML properties of the user
are interpreted using the spring property `pass.auth.attribute-map`. The user is assigned the `SUBMITTER` role.

There is a single `BACKEND` user specified which can be logged in as using HTTP basic.

The `BACKEND` role can do everything. The `SUBMITTER` role is restricted to creating and modifying certain objects in the data model.
The `SUBMITTER` has full access to all other services. 

# SAML configuration

The `PASS_CORE_SP_KEY` and `PASS_CORE_SP_CERT` environment variables set the location of the keys used by pass-core to encrypt SAML communication.
Use `PASS_CORE_SP_ID` to set the identifier of the pass-core SP, `PASS_CORE_IDP_METADATA` to set the location where IDP metadata can be retrieved,
`PASS_CORE_SP_ACS` for the Assertion Consumer Service of the SP and `PASS_CORE_LOGIN_PROCESSING_PATH` to set the path for handling login from the IDP.
Note that `PASS_CORE_SP_ACS` is a URL which must match the path specified in `PASS_CORE_LOGIN_PROCESSING_PATH`.

The defaults are set such that the integration tests can run against a [SimpleSAMLphp based IDP](https://github.com/kenchan0130/docker-simplesamlphp/) using resources included in `saml2/`. These defaults should not be used in production.

The image can be run with:
```
docker run --name=idp -p 8090:8080 -e SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ENTITY_ID=https://sp.pass/shibboleth -e SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE=http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/pass -e SIMPLESAMLPHP_IDP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8090/   -v ./pass-core/pass-core/main/src/main/resources/saml2/authsources.php:/var/www/simplesamlphp/config/authsources.php -d kenchan0130/simplesamlphp
```
Note the volume mount which is set the user information appropriately for PASS.

# CSRF protection

Requests which have side effects (not a GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS and any request to /doi) are protected from CSRF through the use of a token. The client must provide a cookie XSRF-TOKEN and set a header X-XSRF-TOKEN to the same value. Clients can use any value they want. Browser clients will have the cookie value set by responses and so must first make a non-protected request.

# App service

The PASS application is available at `/app/` and `/` is redirected to `/app/`. Requests are resolved against the location given by the environment variable `PASS_CORE_APP_LOCATION`. If a request cannot be resolved, then `/app/index.html` will be returned.  This allows the user interface to handle paths which may not resolve to files.

# User service

The [user service](pass-core-user-service/README.md) provides information about the logged in user.

# DOI service

The [DOI service](pass-core-doi-service/README.md) provides the ability to interact with DOIs.

# File service

The [file service](pass-core-file-service/README.md) provides a mechanism to persist files.

# Metadata Schema service

The [metadata schema service](pass-core-metadataschema-service/README.md) provides JSON schemas intended to describe PASS submission metadata

# Metadata Schema service

The [metadata schema service](pass-core-metadataschema-service/README.md) provides JSON schemas intended to describe PASS submission metadata

# JSON API

JSON API is deployed at `/data/`. All of our data model is available, just divided into attributes and relationships. Note that identifiers are now integers, not URIs.
See https://elide.io/pages/guide/v6/10-jsonapi.html for information on how Elide provides support for filtering and sorting.

See `/swagger/` for auto-generated documentation.


## Creating a RepositoryCopy

```
curl -v -u backend:moo -X POST "http://localhost:8080/data/repositoryCopy" -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" -d @rc1.json
```

*rc1.json:*
```
{
  "data": {
    "type": "repositoryCopy",
    "attributes": {
      "accessUrl": "http://example.com/path",
      "copyStatus": "ACCEPTED"
    }
  }
}
```

## Patch a Journal

Add a publisher object to the publisher relationship in a journal. Note that both the journal and publisher objects must already exist.

```
curl -u backend:moo -X PATCH "http://localhost:8080/data/journal/1" -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" -d @patch.json
```

*patch.json:*
 ```
 {
  "data": {
    "type": "journal",
    "id": "1",
    "relationships": {
      "publisher": {
        "data": {
          "id": "2",
          "type": "publisher"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Messages

Messages are JSON objects emitted to a JMS broker as text messages. The different types of messages are sent to different queues specified
by the indicatedby the environment variables `PASS_CORE_SUBMISSION_QUEUE`, `PASS_CORE_SUBMISSION_EVENT_QUEUE`, and `PASS_CORE_DEPOSIT_QUEUE`.

When a Submission is created or modified and the submitted field is true, then a SubmissionReady event is emitted.
The id of the Submission will be set in the `submission` field of the message.

When a SubmissionEvent is created, then the a SubmissionEvent message will be sent.
The id of the SubmissionEvent will be set in the `submission-event` field of the message. If the `eventType` field is `APPROVAL_REQUESTED_NEWUSER`,
then an `approval-link` field will be set in the field of the message with a link to be sent to a user.

When a Deposit is created or modified, then a DepositStatus event is emitted.
The id of the Deposit will be set in the `deposit` field of the message.

Example messages:
```
{
    "type": "SubmissionReady",
    "submission": "1"
}

{
    "type": "DepositStatus",
    "deposit": "1"
}

{
    "type": "SubmissionEvent",
    "submission-event": "1",
    "approval-link": "http://example.com/passui?userToken=xxxx"
}
```
